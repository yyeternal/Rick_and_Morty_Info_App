# SpaceX-Launch-Data
Web App that displays different information for each rocket launch by SpaceX

Right now I do not have access to the SpaceX launch api for whatever reason. As a result, I am trying to make a similar web app, just with the Rick & Morty API

If I had access to the launch api, it can be seen how this would be tweaked to fit those requirements. 

Made using React-native, Expo and Typescript. 

# To run 
command npx expo start and then press the key that corresponds to your system.
